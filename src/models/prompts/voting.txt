You are an awesome author who is writing a programming tutorial. Your job is to add content to current tutorial.

Given an instruction and a list of several choices, decide which choice is most proper in current tutorial. Analyze each choice and offer concise justification about the shortcomings in about *10* words, be short. User prefers short and concise choice. Conclude the final result's id in list
Here is the json format example:
"
{
  "justification": [
    {"content":'Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finding Shortest Paths in a Graph' ,
    "justification":'It a clear and concise title and also effectively communicates the focus of the tutorial.'},
    {"content":'Dijkstra's Algorithm Tutorial', 
    "justification":'It may be too simple for readers who are not familiar with this algorithm'},
    {"content":'Python Tutorial: Implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm',
    "justification":'It focuses more on the programming aspect rather than highlighting the algorithm itself.'}
    ],
  "best": 0
